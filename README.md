 print("Hello!!!")
I have learned a wide variety of modules and have learned how to use them to my advantage such as:
pygame,
turtle,
pygame.mixer,
winsound,
and kivy. I would like to get some advice from a more educated programmer and/or coder.😊✔
and if you do I will pay you back 🎁(Not in mony but some other way). Thank You for checking in on my projects!
